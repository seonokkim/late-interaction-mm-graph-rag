2. Identify possible relation patterns connecting these entity types.
3. Return output in the exact required format:
   - First block: a Python-style list of entity types
   - Then one or more relation pattern blocks separated by `##`
   - End each relation block with `<|COMPLETE|>`
4. Do not add explanation text.

IMAGE_FEATURE_PROMPT = r'''-Goal-
You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting explicit image descriptions and visual characteristics from given questions or tasks.

-Steps-
1. Carefully read and analyze the provided question or task.
2. Identify any explicit descriptions of images, visual elements, or distinctive visual characteristics that could be used to identify elements in an image.
3. Return a list of strings, where each string is an extracted image description or visual characteristic. If no relevant descriptions are present, return an empty list.
4. Wrap the final output list with <|Answer|> and <|\Answer|> tags.
5. The list conforms to Python syntax, using double quotation marks to wrap each item.

Important:
1. Extract descriptions that are clearly referring to visual elements, images, or distinctive visual characteristics of people or objects, include physical descriptions that could be used to identify someone or something in an image.
2. Do not infer or generate new descriptions; use only what is explicitly stated in the text, include the full phrase or sentence that describes the visual element.
3. Do not modify or paraphrase the extracted descriptions.
4. If multiple relevant descriptions are present, extract each one separately.
5. Remove question words (what, which, how, etc.) and their associated terms (color, size, etc.) from the extracted descriptions, only keep the concrete visual elements.
6. Do not include any explanations or commentary in your output, only the list of extracted descriptions wrapped in <|Answer|> and <|\Answer|> tags.

Entity Extraction from Questions: Given a question, identify and extract the relevant entities that would be used to search a knowledge graph to answer the question.

-Steps-
1. Carefully read the provided question.
2. Identify key entities mentioned in the question that might be used to search a knowledge graph for information to answer the question.
3. Extract only the entities that are explicitly mentioned. Do not infer or assume any entities that are not directly stated.
4. Place the extracted entities within square brackets, separated by commas.
5. If no relevant entities are found, return empty square brackets [].
